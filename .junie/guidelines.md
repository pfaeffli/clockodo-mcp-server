# AI model guidelines

1. Document architecture decisions in README.md. Write down the most important patterns and decisions.
2. Use always TDD when developing
   1. Write tests first.
   2. Run them to verify they fail.
   3. Write the code to make them pass.
2. Make the smallest changes possible.
3. Have fast feedback loops. Always use text boxes for approval or rejection so I can give feedback.
4. Focus on the most essential parts. Do not give verbose feedback if not asked.

## Project-specific

1. Use black formatting
2. Add manual api tests per api implementation to the manual-test notebook.
