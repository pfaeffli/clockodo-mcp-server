# AI model guidelines

1. Use always TDD when developing
2. Make the smallest changes possible.
3. Have fast feedback loops. Always use text boxes for approval or rejection so I can give feedback.
4. Focus on the most essential parts. Do not give verbose feedback if not asked.

## Project-specific

1. Use black formatting
2. Add manual api tests per api implementation to the manual-test notebook.
